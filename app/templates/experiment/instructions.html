        <h3>Advanced Usage - More than 20 attributes</h3>
        
        <p>
            For the slightly advanced user, you may think that 20 attributes are far
            from enough. In this case, there are a few things that you'd ought to know.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When CSV files are uploaded, they are sent to a directory and preprocessed.
            A script removes the <em>protein name</em> (1st column),
            temporarily. The effector attribute is assumed to be the last column.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In order to add a new attribute, you must insert columns between the 14th
            column and the last column.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In order to remove an existing attribute, you must replace said column with
            a column full of useless values. If the column you need to remove is to the
            left of the 14th column you can remove it just fine. If it is to the right
            of the 14th column, you can switch said column with a needed column to the
            right of the 14th column, and delete the column.
